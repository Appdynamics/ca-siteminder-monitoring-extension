ca-siteminder-monitoring-extension
==================================

An AppDynamics extension to be used with a stand alone Java machine agent to provide metrics for CA's Siteminder.


## Use Case ##

CA Site Minder (a.k.a. Netegrity Site Minder SSO) is a web access management system that enables user authentication and secure Internet SSO (single sign-on),
policy-driven authorization, federation of identities, and complete auditing of all access to the web applications it protects.

## Prerequisites ##

This extension extracts the metrics from CA SiteMinder through SNMP.


## Troubleshooting steps ##
Before configuring the extension, please make sure to run the below steps to check if the set up is correct.

1. Telnet into your coherence server from the box where the extension is deployed.
       telnet <hostname> <port>

       <port> - It is the jmxremote.port specified.
        <hostname> - IP address

    If telnet works, it confirm the access to the coherence server.


2. Start jconsole. Jconsole comes as a utility with installed jdk. After giving the correct host and port , check if Coherence
mbean shows up.

## Metrics Provided ##

In addition to the metrics exposed by Coherence, we also add a metric called "Metrics Collection Successful" with a value -1 when an error occurs and 1 when the metrics collection is successful.

Note : By default, a Machine agent or a AppServer agent can send a fixed number of metrics to the controller. To change this limit, please follow the instructions mentioned [here](http://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO14S/Metrics+Limits).
For eg.  
```    
    java -Dappdynamics.agent.maxMetrics=2500 -jar machineagent.jar
```


## Installation ##

1. Run "mvn clean install" and find the CoherenceMonitor.zip file in the "target" folder. You can also download the CoherenceMonitor.zip from [AppDynamics Exchange][].
2. Unzip as "CoherenceMonitor" and copy the "CoherenceMonitor" directory to `<MACHINE_AGENT_HOME>/monitors`


# Configuration ##

Note : Please make sure to not use tab (\t) while editing yaml files. You may want to validate the yaml file using a [yaml validator](http://yamllint.com/)

1. Configure the coherence instances by editing the config.yml file in `<MACHINE_AGENT_HOME>/monitors/CoherenceMonitor/`.
2. Below is the default config.yml which has metrics configured already
   For eg. 
   
   ```

            include:
              - CacheHits : "CacheHits" #The rough number of cache hits since the last time statistics were reset. A cache hit is a read operation invocation (that is, get()) for which an entry exists in this map.
              - CacheMisses : "CacheMisses" #The rough number of cache misses since the last time statistics were reset.
              - CachePrunes : "CachePrunes" #The number of prune operations since the last time statistics were reset. A prune operation occurs every time the cache reaches its high watermark as specified by the HighUnits attribute.
              - TotalGets : "TotalGets" #The total number of get() operations since the last time statistics were reset.
              - TotalPuts : "TotalPuts" #The total number of put() operations since the last time statistics were reset.
              - UnitFactor : "UnitFactor" #The factor by which the Units, LowUnits and HighUnits properties are adjusted. Using a BINARY unit calculator, for example, the factor of 1048576 could be used to count megabytes instead of bytes.
              - Units : "Units" #The size of the cache measured in units. This value needs to be adjusted by the UnitFactor.
              - Size : "Size" #The number of entries in the cache.
              # A derived metric for CacheHitRatio=CacheHits/TotalGets is calculated for every cache.

   ```


The objectNames mentioned in the above yaml may not match your environment exactly. Please use jconsole to extract the objectName and configure it
accordingly in the config.yaml. For eg. you may not find objectName: "Coherence:type=Service,name=DistributedCache,nodeId=*"

Please replace DistributedCache the name in your environment.

3. Configure the path to the config.yml file by editing the <task-arguments> in the monitor.xml file in the `<MACHINE_AGENT_HOME>/monitors/CoherenceMonitor/` directory. Below is the sample

     ```
     <task-arguments>
         <!-- config file-->
         <argument name="config-file" is-required="true" default-value="monitors/CoherenceMonitor/config.yml" />
          ....
     </task-arguments>
    ```
